# Credit_Risk_Analysis


## Overview Of the Project

The purpose of this project is to evaluate the performance of six different supervised machine learning models to predict credit risk on credit card dataset from LendingClub, a peer to peer lending services company. Credit risk dataset is an unbalanced dataset since good credits outnumber risky credits. Therefore, in the first deliverable of this project, we used diffetent resampling methods to train and evaluate models with unbalanced classes.
In the second deliverable of this project, Balanced Random Forest Classifier and Easy Ensemble Classifier machine learning models were applied to the dataset to predict credit risk. By evaluating each of this models, we identify the best model for predicting the credit risk.

## Results 



Results: Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all six machine learning models. Use screenshots of your outputs to support your results.

Summary: Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. If you do not recommend any of the models, justify your reasoning.
